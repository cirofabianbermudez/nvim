# Buses note


## APB (Advances Peripheral Bus)

The Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) protocol is a fundamental part of ARM’s AMBA
(Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) suite.

APB is specifically tailored for **low-power** and **low-bandwidth** peripherals in
System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. Its **non-pipelined**, **simple** architecture makes it
highly efficient for connecting peripheral devices that don’t require
high-speed data transfers.
