# Time Complexity notes


Big - O notation

O(n^{2})
O(n)              Linear
O(log n)          Logarithmic
O(1)              Constant


- We are interested in the rate of growth over time with respect to the inputs
taken during the program execution.

- The Time Complexity of an algorithm/code is not equal to the actial time
required to execute a particular code, but the number of times a statement
executes. 

- Instead of measuring actual time required in executing each statement in the
code. Time Complexity considers how many times each statement executes.
