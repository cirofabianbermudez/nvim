# OOP notes

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolves around four main concepts:

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

Encapsulation bundles data with methods, inheritance lets you create subclasses,
abstraction hides complex details, and polymorphism allows for different 
implementations.

1. **Encapsulation** allows you to bundle data (attributes) and behaviors 
(methods) within a class to create a cohesive unit. By defining methods to 
control access to attributes and its modification, encapsulation helps maintain
data integrity and promotes modular, secure code.

2. **Inheritance** enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between
classes allowing a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a parent 
class. This promotes code reuse and reduces duplication.

3. **Abstraction** focuses on hiding implementation details and exposing only
the essential functionality of an object. By enforcing a consistent interface,
abstraction simplifies interactions with objects, allowing developers to focus
on what an object does rather than how it achieves its functionality.

4. **Polymorphism** allows you to treat object of different types as instances
of the same type, as long as they implement a common interface of behavior.



Classes allow you to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions
called **methods**, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object 
created from the class can perform with its data.

A class is a blueprint for how to define something. While the class is the
blueprint, ans **instance** is an object that's built from a class and contains
real data.

Python's duck typing makes it suited for polymorphism, as it allows you to
access attributes and methods on objects without needing to worry about their
actual class.
